# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning Model
A machine learning project that builds and evaluates predicitve models for breast cancer classification using clinical features. This project aims to demonstrate practical skills 
in data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model development using python.

## Project Overview
Breast Cancer remains one of the most common cancers globally, and early detection dramatically improves treatment outcomes. This project applies supervised machine learning 
algorithms to classify tumors as beningn or malignant, based on features from a breast cancer dataset

The work flow includes:

- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training 
- Model evaluation using multiple metrics 

## Model used
- The project used the Logistic regression model as the predictive algorithm

## Technologies and tools used 
This project was developed using:
- python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplot, Seaborn (for visualization)
-nscikit-learn (ML models, metrics and preprocessing)
